        The data obtained from the Indeed API and the Job Salary Data API played
        a pivotal role in our website's functionality. Using Fetch API in
        combination with React, HTML, and Bootstrap, we seamlessly integrated
        these APIs into our platform. Users can perform real-time job searches,
        view job details, and access salary ranges for specific positions and
        locations. React components efficiently display the retrieved data,
        ensuring a dynamic and responsive user interface. HTML and Bootstrap
        were utilized to structure and style the website, creating an intuitive
        and visually appealing user experience. The combination of these
        technologies allowed us to build a powerful job search and salary
        comparison platform, providing users with valuable insights and
        enhancing their job-seeking journey.
