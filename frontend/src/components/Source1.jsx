        We sourced the APIs for our project from RapidAPI, a platform that
        provides a wide range of APIs for various applications and services.
        Specifically, we used the Indeed API and the Job Salary Data API to

        millions of job listings worldwide. It allowed us to retrieve real-time
        job data, including job titles, descriptions, and locations, which
        significantly enriched our job search platform.

        complement our job search functionality with salary insights. This API
        provided us with valuable data on salary ranges for various job
        positions across different locations. By leveraging this data, we were
        able to offer users a comprehensive salary comparison feature,
        empowering them to make informed decisions during their job search.
